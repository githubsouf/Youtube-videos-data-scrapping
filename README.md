# Youtube-videos-data-scrapping


Project Overview:
The goal of the project is to analyze videos from a YouTube channel, extracting information such as titles and views, and presenting the data in a clear and meaningful way.

Key Components:

Web Scraping with Selenium:
I utilized Selenium, a powerful web scraping library, to navigate through YouTube, search for channels, and collect data on videos. The implementation involved handling dynamic web pages and interacting with elements on the page.

Data Processing and CSV Generation:
After scraping the data, I faced challenges in processing and organizing it. I implemented a mechanism to handle errors gracefully and generate a CSV file with relevant video information. The auto-incremented index and filtering out empty values improved the accuracy and cleanliness of the data.

Data Visualization with Matplotlib:
To make the analysis more insightful, I implemented a data visualization component using Matplotlib. The growth of views over videos is plotted in a graph, providing a visual representation of the channel's performance.

Jupyter Notebook Integration:
I organized the project into a Jupyter Notebook, leveraging its interactive capabilities. The notebook includes markdown cells for clear documentation and titles, improving the readability and structure of the analysis.

Challenges and Solutions:

Handling Errors:
Addressed errors during web scraping by implementing try-except blocks and refining error messages. This ensures that the program continues processing even in the presence of unexpected issues.

Numeric Notations:
Dealt with numeric notations in views (e.g., 1.5M), converting them to standard numeric values for accurate data representation.

Demonstration:
Let's take a look at the project in action. I'll walk you through the Jupyter Notebook, showcasing the scraping process, data generation, and the insightful graph displaying views growth.

Conclusion:
This project has been a journey of learning and improvement. I've overcome challenges, implemented enhancements, and created a tool that can provide valuable insights into YouTube channel performance.

Thank you for your attention, and I'm open to any questions or suggestions you may have!
